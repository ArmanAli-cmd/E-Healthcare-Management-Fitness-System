	        </div>
	        <h2>Overview</h2>
	        <p style=" font-size:16px;">Anxiety is your body natural response to stress. It is a feeling of fear or apprehension about what is to come. 
	        The first day of school, going to a job interview, or giving a speech may cause most people to feel fearful and nervous.</p>
			<br><div class="panel-body">
	        	<img class="img-responsive" style="height:400px;" width="1104"  src="anxiety2.jpg" >
	        </div><p>But if your feelings of anxiety are extreme, last for longer than six months, and are interfering with your life, 
			you may have an anxiety disorder.</p>
			
			<h2>What is anxiety?</h2>
			<p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:16px;">Anxiety is a feeling of fear, dread, and uneasiness. It might cause you to sweat, feel restless and tense, 
			and have a rapid heartbeat. It can be a normal reaction to stress. For example, you might feel anxious when faced with
			a difficult problem at work, before taking a test, or before making an important decision. It can help you to cope. 
			The anxiety may give you a boost of energy or help you focus. But for people with anxiety disorders, the fear is not 
			temporary and can be overwhelming.</p>
			 
			<h2>What are anxiety disorders?</h2> 
			<p style="font-family:monospace; font-size:17px;">It is normal to feel anxious about moving to a new place, starting a new job, or taking a test. This type of anxiety
			 is unpleasant, but it may motivate you to work harder and to do a better job. Ordinary anxiety is a feeling that comes
			 and goes, but does not interfere with your everyday life.</p>
			 <div class="panel-body">

	        </div>
			<p>In the case of an anxiety disorder, the feeling of fear may be with you all the time. It is intense and sometimes debilitating</p>
			<p>This type of anxiety may cause you to stop doing things you enjoy. In extreme cases, it may prevent you from entering
			 an elevator, crossing the street, or even leaving your home. If left untreated, the anxiety will keep getting worse.</p>
			
			<h2>What are the types of anxiety disorders?</h2>
			<p style="font-family:serif; font-size:19px;">Anxiety is a key part of several different disorders. These include:</p>
			<p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:17px;">&#9670; panic disorder: experiencing recurring panic attacks at unexpected times. A person with panic disorder may live
			in fear of the next panic attack.<br>&#9670; phobia: excessive fear of a specific object, situation, or activity <br>
			&#9670; social anxiety disorder: extreme fear of being judged by others in social situations<br>
			&#9670; obsessive-compulsive disorder: recurring irrational thoughts that lead you to perform specific, repeated behaviors<br>
			&#9670; separation anxiety disorder: fear of being away from home or loved ones<br>
			&#9670; illness anxiety disorder: anxiety about your health (formerly called hypochondria)<br>
			&#9670; post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): anxiety following a traumatic event</p>

	        </div>
			<p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:17px;">Anxiety feels different depending on the person experiencing it. Feelings can range from butterflies in your stomach to a 
			racing heart. You might feel out of control, like there is a disconnect between your mind and body.<br>Symptoms of general anxiety include:
			<br>&#9670; increased heart rate<br> &#9670; rapid breathing<br> &#9670; restlessness<br> &#9670; trouble concentrating<br>
			&#9670; difficulty falling asleep</p>
			
			<h2>What is an anxiety attack?</h2>
			<div class="row">
			<div class="col-lg-6">
			<p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:17px;">An anxiety attack is a feeling of overwhelming apprehension, worry, distress, or fear. For many people, an anxiety
			attack builds slowly. It may worsen as a stressful event approaches.Anxiety attacks can vary greatly, and symptoms may
			differ among individuals. That’s because the many symptoms of anxiety don’t happen to everyone, and they can change 
			over time.<br>Common symptoms of an anxiety attack include:<br>
			&#9679; feeling faint or dizzy<br> &#9679; shortness of breath<br> &#9679; dry mouth<br> &#9679; sweating<br> &#9679; chills or hot flashes<br>
			&#9679; apprehension and worry<br> &#9679; restlessness<br> &#9679; distress<br> &#9679; fear<br> &#9679; numbness or tingling</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-6">

	        </div>
			<p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:17px;">Researchers are not sure of the exact cause of anxiety. But, it’s likely a combination of factors play a role.
			These include genetic and environmental factors, as well as brain chemistry.<br>
			In addition, researchers believe that the areas of the brain responsible for controlling fear may be impacted.<br>
			Current research of anxiety is taking a deeper look at the parts of the brain that are involved with anxiety.</p>
		
			<h2>What are treatments for anxiety?</h2>
			<p style="font-family:serif; font-size:19px;">The main treatments for anxiety disorders are psychotherapy (talk therapy), medicines, or both:<br> 
			&#9679; Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that is often used to treat anxiety disorders.
			CBT teaches you different ways of thinking and behaving. It can help you change how you react to the things that cause
			you to feel fear and anxiety. It may include exposure therapy. This focuses on having you confront your fears so that
			you will be able to do the things that you had been avoiding.<br> &#9679; Medicines to treat anxiety disorders include
			anti-anxiety medicines and certain antidepressants. Some types of medicines may work better for specific types of
			anxiety disorders. You should work closely with your health care provider to identify which medicine is best for you.
			You may need to try more than one medicine before you can find the right one.</p>
		
			<h2>What natural remedies are used for anxiety?</h2>
			
	        
			<p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:17px;">Lifestyle changes can be an effective way to relive some of the stress and anxiety you may cope with every day.
			Most of the natural “remedies” consist of caring for your body, participating in healthy activities, and eliminating
			unhealthy ones.<br>These include:</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-3">
			<p style="font-family:serif; font-size:19px;">&#9726; getting enough sleep<br>&#9726; meditating<br>&#9726; staying active and exercising<br>
			&#9726; eating a healthy diet<br>&#9726; staying active and working out<br>&#9726; avoiding alcohol<br>
			&#9726; avoiding caffeine<br>&#9726; quitting smoking cigarettes</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-9">

			<div class="panel-body">
	        	<img class="img-responsive" style="height:400px;" width="1104"  src="mom-comforting-kid.png" >
	        </div>
			<p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:17px;">Anxiety in children is natural and common. In fact, one in eight children will experience anxiety. As children grow
			up and learn from their parents, friends, and caretakers, they typically develop the skills to calm themselves and 
			cope with feelings of anxiety.<br>But, anxiety in children can also become chronic and persistent, developing into an
			anxiety disorder. Uncontrolled anxiety may begin to interfere with daily activities, and children may avoid 
			interacting with their peers or family members.<br>Symptoms of an anxiety disorder might include:<br>&#9670; jitteriness<br>
			&#9670; irritability<br>&#9670; sleeplessness<br>&#9670; feelings of fear<br>&#9670; shame<br>&#9670; feelings of isolation<br>
